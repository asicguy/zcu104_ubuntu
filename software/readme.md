# Software
## Linux Installation
See software/petalinux/readme.txt for instructions on how to run Ubuntu Desktop Linux from the SD card of the ZCU104.  Honestly, this is process is pretty easy. You can probably do all the steps in less than thirty minutes.
## Simple C++ FPGA access using GCC under Ubuntu
See software/app/bram_test folder.
## Open Source Linux (OSL) Ubuntu flow
Look under software/OSL/readme.md.  Right now these instructions don't result in a a successful Ubuntu installation. I prefer working from primary source but could not get this to work. I may come back to it later.
